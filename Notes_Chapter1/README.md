### CPU: 	
Part of a computer that runs programs. Without CPU, computer could not run software.
A program is a sequence of instructions stored in the computer’s memory. CPU is engaged in a process known formally as below:

- Fetch: The CPU’s control unit fetches, from main memory (computer’s work area), the next instruction in the sequence of program instructions. 
- Decode: The instruction is encoded in the form of a number. The control unit decodes the instruction and generates an electornic signal.
- Execute: The signal is routed to the appropriate component caused them to perform an operations.

### Main Memory (RAM)
Where the compoter stores a program while the program is running, as well as the data that the program is working with.

RAM is called this because the CPU is able to quickly access data stored at any random loaciton in this memory.Only used for temporary storage while a program is running.

Computer's memory is divided into tiny storage cells known as bytes. One byte is enough momory to stroe just a single letter or a small number. Each byte is devided into eight smaller storage locations known as bits. (Tiny components that can hold either a positive or a negative charge)
