** Description:  Program reads in the name of the file, and then tries to open it.

                 If the input file is there and can be opened, the program should 
                 read the list of integers in the file, which will have one integer 
                 per line.

                 If the input file is not there (or is there but couldn't be opened 
                 for some reason), the program should just print out "could not 
                 access file".

                 The program will then add together all the integers in the file, 
                 create an output file called sum.txt, write the sum to that file 
                 (just that number - no additional text), and then print (to the 
                 console) "result written to sum.txt".

                 In the end, close both the input and output files.
