# Abstract Data Types - LinkedList, Stacks, Queue

## Chapter 17

To insert or remove a value at the beginning or middle of a vector is O(n).  For a linked list, the same operations are O(1).
Linked lists can be tricky because they involve lots of pointer manipulation, and you have to keep careful track of what is pointing to what at different steps along the way.  Pictures (like the ones shown in the text) can be very helpful in keeping mental track.

## Chapter 18
Stacks and queues are simply more specialized versions of linked lists.  
They also serve as a useful case study in the design of abstract data types.
