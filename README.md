# CS 165 Assignment

## How to Submit HW
- Test on flip to make sure it works correctly in that environment. 
- Submit assignments on Mimir.
- Remember that when you submit your project, you will only see results for the "visible" tests.  
- You won't see the results for the "hidden" tests until after the due date has passed.
- Always get your code working on flip before submitting it on Mimir - otherwise you're just wasting submissions, of which you only have five.

## Code Style Guidelines
- A comment block should appear at the top of every file 
- (at first each program will consist of just one file, but soon we'll be using multiple files for a single program)

```c
/********************************************************************* 
** Author: 
** Date:
** Description:
*********************************************************************/ 
```
- Every function should be preceded by a comment block, which describe the purpose of the function. 
- (when we get to classes and objects, "get" and "set" functions will be an exception to this rule)
- If a file contains only a single function, then the file comment block alone will suffice.

```c
/********************************************************************* 
** Description:
*********************************************************************/ 
```
