# Chapter 9

- Insertion sort is another sorting algorithm.  Like bubble sort and selection sort its worst-case time is O(n2),but it has a different best-case.  When the values are already nearly sorted, insertion sort runs in O(n).

- Quick sort, as its name would suggest, is one of the faster sorting algorithms.  There are other algorithms with - a better worst-case complexity - merge sort and heap sort both run in O(n lg n) worst-case, whereas for quick sort the worst-case is O(n2), the same as bubble sort!  However the average running time for quick sort is O(n lg n), and its worst case is highly improbable, so it's still a fast algorithm.

- Big-O doesn't tell you how much actual time an algorithm will take.  It tells you how quickly that time increases as the size of the input increases.

- In addition to time complexity, you can also compare the space complexity of different algorithms, which concerns how much additional space an algorithm needs to use.  There is often a tradeoff between the amount of time and the amount of space an algorithm requires.

- In coding interviews you'll be expected to be able to talk about running times.  They'll ask you to figure out the code for something on a white board and often they'll ask you about its running time and whether you can think of a way to do it that uses less time or memory.
